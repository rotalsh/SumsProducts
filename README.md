# Sums Products
A riddle:
Let x and y be two numbers larger than 1 such that their sum does not exceed 100. Sean is told what the sum x+y is and Paul is told what the product x*y is.   
Sean: You don't know what x and y are.  
Paul: I do now.  
Sean: I do too.  
What are x and y?  

Extension: what can x and y also be if there is no limit on how large they are?
